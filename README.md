# Finite Automata Machines
They are abstract machines with a finite set of states used ot recognize patterns and process languages in computational systems.

## DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata)
Finite sttate machines where each state has exactly one transition for every input symbol, ensuring deterministic pattern recognition and language processing.
